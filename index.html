             Creating a product or service that fulfills a consumer need is necessary for a small business to achieve success, but a strong concept alone is not enough to ensure profitability. Small businesses have to convince consumers to try a new product and find ways to deliver those products to consumers to be successful.
              <br>
              <br>
              Computers can be a powerful tool for assisting small companies in many aspects of marketing new products and services. With many free apps and program available to help businesses track their customer interactions, the uses of technology in marketing are becoming a more important piece of the sales puzzle.
              <br>
              <br>
              The methods that a company uses to distribute products and services to customers are a core component of its overall marketing strategy. Computers allow companies to distribute their products and services to remote users via the internet, without the need for a physical office or retail storefront. Digital distribution can be advantageous to small companies that want to sell to consumers all across the country and keep start-up costs low.
